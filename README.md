# Big-Sur-Desktop-Machine
Transform your desktop into a lovely big sur theme.
To use the tool, make sure you have git installed. If you don't have it, just type in a terminal (for debian-based distros only):
sudo apt install git
Once you have git installed, you need to find a place on your disk to put the files. When you are ready, type:
git clone
